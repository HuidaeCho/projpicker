# ProjPicker

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/projpicker.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/projpicker)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/projpicker/badge/?version=latest)](https://projpicker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

[ProjPicker](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/projpicker) (projection picker) is a
Python module that allows the user to select all coordinate reference systems
(CRSs) whose extent completely contains given points, polylines, polygons, and
bounding boxes using set-theoretic logical operators in a postfix notation. The
goal is to make it easy and visual to select a desired projection by location.
This project was motivated by
[a GRASS GIS feature request](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/issues/1253).
See [its documentation](https://projpicker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The project uses a copy of [GetOSM](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/getosm) to
download OpenStreetMap tiles.

ProjPicker Web is online at https://projpicker.pythonanywhere.com/.

For [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/), a new module
[g.projpicker](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass78/manuals/addons/g.projpicker.html)
that wraps around this project is available.

## Change log

See [here](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/projpicker/blob/main/ChangeLog.md).

## TODO

1. [JavaScript API](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/projpicker-js)
2. Client-only web UI
3. CRS hints: Crowdsourcing agency and product information? Is usage from PROJ enough?

## Versioning

`N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]`

* [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/)
* `{a|b|rc|.dev}N` towards and `.postN` away from the release
* Not fully compatible with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
* Not using build numbers marching away from or towards a release, but check
  this [interesting
  comment](https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/51#issuecomment-9718111).
