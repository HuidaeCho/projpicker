Welcome to ProjPicker's documentation!
======================================

ProjPicker (projection picker) allows the user to select all coordinate reference systems (CRSs) whose extent completely contains given points, polylines, polygons, and bounding boxes. The goal is to make it easy and visual to select a desired projection by location.

This project is kindly funded by `the Institute for Environmental and Spatial Analysis <https://ung.edu/institute-environmental-spatial-analysis/>`_ (IESA) at `the University of North Georgia <https://ung.edu/>`_ (UNG).
